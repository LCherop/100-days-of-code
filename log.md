### Day 3: February 5, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Loops in python. Reinvented the Wolf, Goat and cabbage riddle using if statements. Leap year determiner.

**Thoughts:** Reinforced my knowledge on syntax but looking forward to implementing tasks with for loops and lists since exclusive use of if statements for the problem was quite cumbersome. Had to edit the game a little.
